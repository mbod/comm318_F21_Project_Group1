# Comm 318 Presentation

## Initial Presentation

Initially we wannted to look at the relationship between social media and mental health. Specifically how social media usage affects happiness across the United States and how has this changed since the start of the pandemic? We expected that high social media use would be correlated with bad mental health, particularly among young people. 
However, during the pandemic when the only way to interact with people was online, we expected that this effect may have been reduced or even reversed.
We wanted to look at social media and mental health variables across multiple years and broken down by state, age group, and social media platform. Then we planned on looking at the correlation between mental health and scoial media usage for each demographic. 
We were able to find some data sets including: 
* From Pew Research Center: Social Media Data focused on usage broken down by age group, social media platform, and other categories from 2005 to 2021
* From USA Facts - Depression rates for American from 2011 to 2019 seperated by state.
* From Statista - percentage of people in the US who suffer from depression from 1990 to 2017. 
* The World Happiness Report


## Issues With Initial Presentation

We ended up changing our project idea from social media and mental health to health and election results, which we'll describe below. Essentially there was not enough data for social media and mental health for us to preform any significant analysis. The data sets we could find did not have a lot of overlapping dimensions, the years would be different, one would be split up by age group and another wouldn't. Thus we had little choice but to change out project. 

## Final Presentation

For out final project and presentation, we decided to look at the healthcare paradox, which essentially is the idea that people who would benefit from state provided health insurance oppose policies which would expand it. Specifically we wanted to explore these key questions: 
* Does the paradox exist?
* How can we explain this paradox?
* Does health insurance actually improve health outcomes?
* Do highly uninsured counties even have access to healthcare?
* Are people unaware of the benefits of having insurance?
* Is healthcare considered a key voting issue?

We expected that the health paradox does exist however healthcare would be viewed as a less important voting issue than other topics which explains why people who are uninsured vote against policies like the ACA.

Do preform our analysis we looked at two data sets. From County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation, we found a dataset that had many soceoeconomic and health variables such as median income, mental health, physical health, overall health, levels of insurance, rural population, and many more. From a github repository by user tonmcg, https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-20, we found a data set that had county level voting data for the presidential election in 2020 that was gathered from The Guardian, townhall.com, Fox News, Politico, and the New York Times. 

From there we split up the data sets, clenaed them, and started to look at how individual data sets correlate with each other. Once we had a grasp on this we started combining our data sets and look at how voting, health, and socioeconomic variables interact with each other. Some of our initial findings were as unisurance rates decreases health also decreases, and that republicans seem to have higher uninsured rates. 

We then started to pick out our most important data findings and we created our final presentation walking through our findings in the final_data_story folder.
